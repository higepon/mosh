<h1>Abstract</h1>
This SRFI specifies the procedure get-environment-variable, which gets
the value of the specified environment variable, and the procedure
get-environment-variables, which gets an association list of all
environment variables.

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>Most operating systems provide a mechanism for passing auxiliary
parameters implicitly to child processes.  Usually, this mechanism is
called "the environment", and is conceptually a map from string names
to string values.  The string names are called enviornment
variables.</p>

<p>Some applications rely on environment variables to modify their
behavior according to local settings.  Also, various established
protocols rely on environment variables as a form of interprocess
communication.  For example, most implementations of the common
gateway interface (CGI) use environment variables to pass
Meta-Variables from the server to the script <a href="#0.1_cgi">[1]</a>.
Environment variables are also required
by <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-96/srfi-96.html" title="SRFI
96: SLIB Prerequisites">SRFI 96: SLIB Prerequisites</a>.
Providing a means to access environment variables is therefore
indispensable for writing practical programs in Scheme.
</p>
<p>Most widely-used Scheme implementations provide a function for
getting the value of a specified environment variable.  The name for
this function is usually getenv, but varies (<a href="#0.1_appendix">see
below</a>).  Some implementations also provide a way to get all the
environment variables, but others do not.</p>
<p>This SRFI specifies a uniform interface for accessing environment
variables.  That should make it easier to write portable programs
that need access to their environment.
For example, a CGI program may portably obtain the values of the
Meta-Variables "QUERY_STRING", "CONTENT_LENGTH" and
"REQUEST_METHOD" as in the following examples:</p>
<pre>(get-environment-variable "QUERY_STRING") =&gt; "foo=bar&amp;huga=hige"
(get-environment-variable "CONTENT_LENGTH") =&gt; "512"
(get-environment-variable "REQUEST_METHOD") =&gt; "post"
</pre>

<h1>Specification</h1>
<pre>R6RS library name</pre>
The following two procedures belong to the R6RS library named (system).
This is a provisional library name until the naming rules for R6RS SRFI libraries are specified.
<pre>Function: get-environment-variable name</pre>Returns the value of
the named environment variable as a string, or #f if the named
environment variable is not found. The name argument is expected to be
a string.
get-environment-variable may use
locale-setting information to encode the name and decode the value of
the environment variable.
If get-environment-variable can't decode the value, get-environment-variable may raise an exception.</p>
<pre>(get-environment-variable "PATH") =&gt; "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"
</pre>
<pre>Function: get-environment-variables</pre>
Returns names and values of all the environment variables as an a-list.
The same decoding considerations as for get-environment-variable apply.
<pre>(get-environment-variables) =&gt; (("PATH" . "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin") ("USERNAME" . "taro"))
</pre>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Gauche</h2>
<pre>
(define get-environment-variable sys-get-env)
(define get-environment-variables sys-environ-&gt;alist)
</pre>
<h2>Scheme48</h2>
<pre>
(define (get-environment-variable name)
  (cond
    ((lookup-environment-variable name) => os-string->string)
    (else #f)))
(define (get-environment-variables)
  (map (lambda (p)
        (cons (os-string->string (car p)) (os-string->string (cdr p))))
       (environment-alist)))
</pre>
<h2>scsh</h2>
<pre>
(define get-environment-variable getenv)
(define get-environment-variables env-&gt;alist)
</pre>

<h2>SCM</h2>
<pre>
(define get-environment-variable getenv)
(define get-environment-variables getenv)
</pre>

<h1>Issues</h1>
<p>get-environment-variable is expected to return a "Scheme string".
Unfortunately, many current platforms, including POSIX-like ones, do
not require environment variables to be interpretable as sequences of
characters.  In particular, environment variables can be used to name
files, and filenames on the system can amount to NULL-terminated byte
vectors, which, if the Scheme program were to collect uninterpreted
and pass to, say, the open call, would work just fine, but which might
not represent a string in the particular encoding the program expects.
While in principle it may be desirable to provide a mechanism for
accessing environment variables raw, this SRFI specifies a "string"
return type because that best represents the consensus of existing
implementations, and captures the semantically desirable behavior in
the common case that the byte sequence is interpretable as a string.</p>
