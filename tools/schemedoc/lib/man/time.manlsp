(abstract . " This is the date and time library, on which many LAML facilities rely. Time is represented as an integer, which represents the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. This library contains functions which translate from seconds to year, month, day, hour, and second.  Also the reverse translation is provided for. Besides this, the library provides functions for calculating the weekday and the week number. Weekday and month names can be returned in either Danish og English, depending on the variable language-preference. The language-preference binds at a late time, not loadning time. Be aware that you need to modify the variable time-zone-info when summer time (daylight saving time) is started and ended. ") (scheme-source-file .
