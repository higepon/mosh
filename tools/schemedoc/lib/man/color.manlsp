(abstract . " A library which contains the basic of handling colors in LAML. The library has encoding functions that convert rgb color lists, such as (rgb-color 255 255 255)  and (255 255 255) to a strings, such as \"#ffffff\". The primary color encoding function is rgb-color-encoding. The primary color representation function is make-rgb-color, which is accompanied by the color predicate rgb-color? a the color selectors red-of-rgb-color, green-of-rgb-color, and blue-of-rgb-color. <p> Of historical reasons we support two representation of colors. The first - the old representation - is just a list of red, green,  blue numbers (positive integers between 0 and 255), such as (255 0 255). The other is a tagged list of red, green, blue values such as (rgb-color 255 0 255), where rgb-color is the tag symbol.  Please be aware of the two different representations when you use this library.<p> The library also contains a set of color constants, all bound to the old color format (of backward compatibility reasons).")
