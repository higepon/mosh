Some of the variables - the configuration variables - are defined via the LAML configuration process. It also contains some very fundamental LAML stuff, including a number of top level commands that activate LAML tools. Physically, laml.scm is composed of a tiny, configuration dependent file followed by the file laml-fundamental.scm. These two files are documented together.<p> <kbd>laml.scm</kbd> loads  the scheme/OS/platform specific compatibility file and the <a href=\"../lib/man/general.html\">general library</a> from the <kbd>lib</kbd> directory. It is assumed that the value of the variable <kbd>laml-dir</kbd> is the full path of the LAML directory; <kbd>laml-dir</kbd> must be defined when <kbd>laml.scm</kbd> is loaded, and the path must end in a \"/\".
