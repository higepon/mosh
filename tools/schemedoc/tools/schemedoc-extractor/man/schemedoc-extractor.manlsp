(abstract . " This is the LAML SchemeDoc tool (a library) which extracts interface documentation of a Scheme source program. It is not likely that you wish to use the functions in this library directly.  The SchemeDoc extraction facilities are normally used via <a href = \"../../../styles/xml-in-laml/schemedoc-2/man/schemedoc.html\"> LAML SchemeDoc</a>.</b> See also the <a href=\"http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/schemedoc/\">SchemeDoc home page</a>. <p> Interface documentation is found in two, three or four semicolon Lisp comments. This is called <em>multi semicolon comment style</em>. From version 25 of LAML we also support <em>documentation mark commenting style</em>, in which  interface comments are marked with a distinguished character, per default '!'.  A number of internal tags in the comments make it possible to express a variety of interface properties in a structured way. <p> The main procedure of the tool is extract-documentation-from-scheme-file. Two additional functions used for internal purposes are also documented. <p> If you read this via the documentation and manual facility, this text is extracted from the Scheme source file and presented as a LAML manual. As such, Schemedoc has simply been used on its own source file.<p> We recommend that you consult <a href=\"../../../tutorial/schemedoc/schemedoc.html\">\"SchemeDoc and Manual pages\"</a> for a tutorial  introduction to SchemeDoc.<p>") (scheme-source-file .
