This directory contains command files which start LAML processing.

The laml and laml.bat command files are produced by the LAML
configuration program, which you run when you install LAML on your
machine.

laml.bat          is for windows
laml              is for unix   

Make the Unix command files executable: chmod 755, for instance.

On both Unix and Windows: Add the LAML bin directory to the path, 
such that the operating system is able to find the laml command.


The files make_default_laml_windows_installation.bat and 
make_default_schemedoc_windows_installation.bat take care of simple
windows installation of LAML.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The less important part:

absolute-laml     for unix   

absolute-laml requires two parameters: the absolute path to the
directory and the laml file (without extension).
