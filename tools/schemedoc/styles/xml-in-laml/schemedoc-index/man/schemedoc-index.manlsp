"This is the manual of the SchemeDoc Index facility. A SchemeDoc index is a frame-based\n            browser that covers a number of SchemeDoc manuals. In addition, it is possible\n            to include and integrate an index of the Scheme Report (either R4RS or R5RS). Basically, a SchemeDoc Index just enumerates the SchemeDoc manuals which should be\n               part of the index. The LAML & Scheme Browser and its LAML source is a good example of a concrete SchemeDoc Index. There is also an example of a SchemeDoc index and browser here. See also the LAML SchemeDoc home page.")
