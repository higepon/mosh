A directory with a HTML version of the R5RS Scheme manual (full distribution only).
The original version of the R5RS HTML files was created by A. Jaffer.

scheme-knowledge.scm contains a mapping of form names to anchors in the manual.
This mapping is used for the LAML/Scheme browser of the LAML distribution.
It is also used by the Scheme Elucidator.

The man directory contains extracts of R5RS, in the LAML SchemeDoc format. 
The purpose of this information is to provide useful R5RS information for
Scheme programmers who use Emacs.

My contributions:

1. I have moved many (more than 200) anchor names up in front of the manual entries, such
   that the header lines are visible after navigations. This was done by the
   Emacs lisp functions in emacs-support/r5rs-fix.el.

2. Fixing layout of do and syntax-rules.

3. Defined the mapping in scheme-knowledge.lsp.
   The sorted, similar mapping from r4rs was used. New R5RS stuff added.
   New classifications: primitive, library, optional added.

4. White space added at the bottom of some HTML files 
  (to allow navigation to bottom parts).
