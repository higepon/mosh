The main purpose is to present <em>internal program documentation</em> side by side with a number of source programs. The leftmost window shows the documentation, and the rightmost window one of the programs. The topmost window is a menu and index window, from which a number of aspects can be controlled.</p> <p><em>Elucidative programming</em> is variant of <a href="http://www.loria.fr/services/tex/english/litte.html">literate programming</a>, as coined by Knuth in the early eighties. In most literate programming tools (called WEB tools), fragments of programs are defined inside the program documentation. In literate programming, a tool (called tangle) can extract and assemble the program fragments according to the rules of the programming language. Another tool (called weave) formats the documentation, generates indexes, and presents all of it in a nice-looking format.</p> <p>The main characteristics of Elucidative Programming in relation to Literate Programming are:</p> <ol><li><font color="#ff0000"><b>The program source files are not affected at all.</b></font> <br /> It is not necessary to split the programs into fragments, and to organize these in the context of the program explanations. An existing program source file can be handled.</li> <li><font color="#ff0000"><b>The program and the documentation are shown side by side.</b></font> <br /> We do not go for an embedded presentation of the program inside its documentation. Rather, we provide for mutual navigation between program and documentation in a two-frame layout</li> <li><font color="#ff0000"><b>The program units which we document, are whole abstractions.</b></font> <br /> Things get simpler when we can settle on documentation of named abstractions instead of arbitrary program fragments (sometimes called &#39;chunks&#39; or &#39;scraps&#39;)</li> <li><font color="#ff0000"><b>An elucidative program is presented on-line, in an Internet browser.</b></font> <br /> Literate programming tools are primary oriented towards presentation of the weaved results on paper.</li> <li><font color="#ff0000"><b>The elucidator tool use specific knowledge about the programming language.</b></font> <br /> <span>The language knowledge is used to identify the names in the program. Applied names are related to their definitions, and the program is decorated with colors and extensive linking. Currently we support the programming language  <a href="http://www.schemers.org">Scheme</a>  and Java (see  <a href="http://dopu.cs.auc.dk/portal.html">the web pages about the Java elucidator</a> ).</span></li> <li><font color="#ff0000"><b>Program and documentation indexes are available.</b></font> <br /> A table of contents, an index of the program definitions, and a cross reference index is available</li> <li><font color="#ff0000"><b>The creation of an elucidative program is supported by a special set of Emacs editor commands.</b></font> <br /> In that way it is realistic to handle the practical aspect of documenting a program while it is written</li></ol> <p>A <em>documentation bundle</em> consist of a single documentation file, a number of program files, and a setup file. The documentation file can be written in Scheme with LAML (using a mirror of a particular XML language for elucidative programming). In case the documentation is written in Scheme, the setup and the documentation are written in the same file. Alternatively, the documentation can be written in simple, separate textual format, which allows the use of native HTML tags for formatting. As mentioned above, there are no special requirements to the program files. The setup file is an XML-in-LAML Scheme file, which describes the the constituents of the documentation bundle together with a number of processing parameters. Running the setup file through a Scheme processor generates the HTML pages shown in this browser.</p> <p>The icons in the menu and index frame (at the top) are now described:</p> <table border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="100" valign="top"><b>Icon</b></td> <td width="600" valign="top"><b>Explanation</b></td></tr> <tr><td width="100" valign="top"><img src="./images/three-frames.gif" title="Icon name: three-frames.gif" alt="" border="0" /></td> <td width="600" valign="top">Reset the elucidator to vertical layout (the default layout).

This is an alternative layout in which the documentation and a selected program are shown under each other, in full width</td></tr> <tr><td width="100" valign="top"><img src="./images/index.gif" title="Icon name: index.gif" alt="" border="0" /></td> <td width="600" valign="top">Presents an index of all defined names in the menu and index frame, just below the icons at the top of the window. The index is pr. default broken into fragments according to starting letter of the defined name.</td></tr> <tr><td width="100" valign="top"><img src="./images/cross-index.gif" title="Icon name: cross-index.gif" alt="" border="0" /></td> <td width="600" valign="top">Presents a cross reference index in the menu and index frame. A cross reference index relates all applied names to the definition, in which they occur. The index is pr. default broken into fragments according to starting letter of the applied name.</td></tr> <tr><td width="100" valign="top"><img src="./images/xx.gif" title="Icon name: xx.gif" alt="" border="0" /></td> <td width="600" valign="top">Present an index of all named defined more than once in the documentation bundle.

If you select an item in the menu, the selected program will be shown in the program frame. It is possible to switch between showing program source files and SchemeDoc manual files.</p> <p>From the documentation frame (the large to the left) it is possible to adjust the program window, such that a given piece of program is shown. Similarly, from the program frame (the large frame to the right), the yellow left arrows <img src="./images/doc-left.gif" title="Icon name: doc-left.gif" alt="" border="0" /> can be used to find the section in the documentation, which <em>explains</em> the particular program unit. The light yellow arrows <img src="./images/doc-left-weak.gif" title="Icon name: doc-left-weak.gif" alt="" border="0" /> refer to a documentation section which <em>mentions</em> the definition (as opposed to explaining it). We talk about strong and weak relations between the documentation and the program resp. Besides these means of navigation it is possible to navigate inside the documentation frame (from section to section), and inside the program frames (from applied name to the similar definitions, as well as to cross reference indexes).</p> <p>Inside the program and inside documentation sections you may find small color bullets like <img src="./images/source-mark-red.gif" title="Icon name: source-mark-red.gif" alt="" border="0" />. These are called <em>source markers</em>. The source markers are used to point out a particular place in a piece of program, which is discussed in a documentation section. You can click on a source marker in the documentation in order to navigate to the corresponding source marker in the program. Also navigation in the opposite direction is supported from most source markers. The popup text, which appears in most browsers when the cursor rests on a source marker, gives useful additional information about the source marker. Notice that a source marker in the documentation is associated with the closest preceding <em>strong</em> documentation-program relation.</p> <p>This instance of the Scheme Elucidator has  8 different links to SchemeDoc manuals. You find these in the upper right corner, possibly by pressing  &quot;Show Manual Menu&quot;. The links to SchemeDoc manuals are dark green in the default CSS stylesheet.</p> <p>This Elucidator provides links the R5RS Scheme manual. Links to syntax items are anchored in black bold words. Links to standard procedures are dark brown in the default CSS stylesheet.</p> <p>The source programs are, by default, shown using a fairly small font size. The small square symbols  <img src="./images/small-square.gif" title="Icon name: small-square.gif" alt="" border="0" />  can be used to toggle the program frames to use larger font. Notice that the small square symbol is only shown in certain configurations (when the variable  <kbd>make-large-source-files?</kbd>  is true or in the case that variable default-program-font-size is set to large)</p> <p>The icon  <img src="./images/small-green-up-triangle.gif" title="Icon name: small-green-up-triangle.gif" alt="" border="0" />  is an anchor of a link from a definition to an entry in the cross reference index. This link is very convenient because it allows us to follow call chains via the cross reference index: Go from a definition of N to the cross reference entry N. Find via that entry a function F which calls N; Go the cross reference entry of F, and find a function G which calls F, etc.</p> <p>Many details of the presentation, such as colors, can be controlled via CSS stylesheets. You may have a <kbd>stylesheets</kbd> directory in the directory with the LAML setup file. Within this directory two files, <kbd>program.css</kbd> and <kbd>documentation.css</kbd>, affect the presentation details. Your own <kbd>program.css</kbd> and <kbd>documentation.css</kbd> files are appended to the systems CSS files, thereby overruling the systems presentation preferences. You should take a look at the CSS stylesheets that come with the Scheme Elucidator. They are located in <kbd>styles/xml-in-laml/elucidator/stylesheets/</kbd> relative to you <kbd>laml</kbd> directory.</p> <p>The Scheme Elucidator can handle a program source files in several different versions. The grey arrows, <img src="./images/gray-left-arrow.gif" title="Icon name: gray-left-arrow.gif" alt="" border="0" /> and <img src="./images/gray-right-arrow.gif" title="Icon name: gray-right-arrow.gif" alt="" border="0" />, shown in the program frame, allow navigation from one version to another. In the documentation, links shown on a <span style="background:#c8c8c8;">grey background</span>,  go to older versions of the program. - When versions are handled, the icons <img src="./images/new.gif" title="Icon name: new.gif" alt="" border="0" />, <img src="./images/updated.gif" title="Icon name: updated.gif" alt="" border="0" /> , <img src="./images/renamed.gif" title="Icon name: renamed.gif" alt="" border="0" />, <img src="./images/moved.gif" title="Icon name: moved.gif" alt="" border="0" />, and <img src="./images/no-pass-sign.gif" title="Icon name: no-pass-sign.gif" alt="" border="0" /> are used to signal a new definition in this version, an existing but updated definition in this version, a definition renamed from relative to a similar defintion in an older version, an identical definition moved from another source file, and a definition which does not appear in the next version, repectively. - The icons <img src="./images/doc-left-point.gif" title="Icon name: doc-left-point.gif" alt="" border="0" /> and <img src="./images/doc-left-weak-point.gif" title="Icon name: doc-left-weak-point.gif" alt="" border="0" /> are used to refer to documention, in which we have asked for  <em>specific versions</em> of a program unit. Thus, these icons refer to documentation of specif versions of the software.</p> <p>The elucidator is written in Scheme, using the  <a href="http://www.cs.aau.dk/~normark/laml/">LAML</a>  software package.</p> <p><em>You can use the browser&#39;s back button to establish the original contents of this frame, or you can activate the reset elucidator icon in the top left corner to return to the standard layout.</em></p> <p>Kurt NÅ√Å∏rmark <br /> Aalborg University <br /> normark@cs.auc.dk <br /> <a href="http://www.cs.aau.dk/~normark/">http://www.cs.aau.dk/~normark/</a></p></body></html>
